# ShowCased

ShowCased ðŸŽ¬ is your app to discover new shows and track what you've already seen. It gives personal recommendations based on your watch lists ðŸ‘€ - the more you use it the better it becomes ðŸ’ª

## Motivation

This app was created as the capstone project for my bootcamp around web development. The idea was to have an on-the-go app that will show recommendations independent of any particular streaming provider but still based on a viewing profile.

## Features

- Dynamic updates on new and trending shows
- Recommendations based on your watch lists
- Extensive API (_The Movie Database_)
- User authentication

## Development / Deployment

Install client and server dependencies:

```
npm install
cd client
npm install
```

Add environment variables in .env file. You can copy the .env.example and update the variables.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

For this app to run you need to have a key for _The Movie Database API_. You need to make an account [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup?language=en-US) and then you find your key under settings -> API.

Also for the user authentication a jwt secret is needed.

_Please update these two variables in the `.env`!_

To start the server and client in development mode at the same time:

```
npm run dev
```

To also run the storybook alongside server and client:

```
npm run dev-story
```

If you like to run the production build, you have to build the client first.

```
npm run build
npm start
```
